Welcome to Jeb!

Jeb! is a currently in-development iOS app that is absolute shit. 
The app is simple, tap, and you get a jeb on your screen!
Use the jeb counter at the bottom of the screen to keep track of the number of jebs

Oh did I mention that there are Jeb soundbites BUILT-IN?

The app supports many features such as:
- Landscape & Portrait view
- Aforementioned jeb counter
- Slider to disable soundbites

I understand that this app would make me millions on the app store, I get that.
However, I currently can not fork up the $99 apple developer license to do so.

So in the meantime, enjoy the source code.
